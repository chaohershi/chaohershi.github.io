These tools have been used to set up my blog:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

  A web hosting service offered by GitHub for hosting static web pages.
  > Hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.

- [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)

  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator used by GitHub Pages.
  > Whenever you push to a specially named branch of your repository, the content is run through the Jekyll static site generator, and served via its own domain.

  Jekyll-Now is like a "minimal working example" of Jekyll. It has been set up and ready to be forked and run. It also features a minimalist layout theme, which is very much to my taste.

- [Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/)

  A marketplace for icons. My blog's icon came from [here](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/48-bubbles).

- [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)

  A favicon generator for all browsers, all platforms. You can also check your existing favicon with their online tool to see what can be improved.
