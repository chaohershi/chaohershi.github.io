title: How to Force HTTPS Using the .htaccess
---

Long story short, I purchased a domain and hosted it with [FastComet](https://www.fastcomet.com/) a week ago. After setting up the SSL/TLS, I tried to force all web traffic to use HTTPS. One way of achieving this would be adding the following code in the .htaccess file in the websiteâ€™s root folder.

```apache
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```

Code that does the same job but written in slightly different syntax:

```apache
RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80 
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [L,R=301]
```
